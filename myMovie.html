        <p>
            I don't know if I have a favorite movie. I really like Iron Man 2, 
            so I guess I'll go with that. I like this movie because I like superhero movies, 
            but I think the second one is the best of the Iron Man trilogy. He goes through a 
            tremendous amount of character growth and all of the background is already set. Plus, 
            the villain is super cool.
